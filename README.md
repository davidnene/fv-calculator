## Net Present Value (NPV) of Money Calculator

- This app calculates both Simple Interest and Compound interest of money.
### Formulae
 - Total amount (Simple interest) = (Principle * interest(%) * time(years)) + principle
 - Total amount (Compound interest) = Principle(1 + interest(%))**time(years)

#### Note
- To try new values, clear output to refresh the app.

### Contribution
- This project is open-source and invites contributers to make it better.
    #### Bug Fix
  - The functionality is on the calculation type input onChange function.
  - This makes it challenging to update values and do another calculation
  - You need to first clear output and input new values afresh
  - If you can move it to the main onSubmit function and keep the functionality working, this problem will be solved.
